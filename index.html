        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Dedicated educator and versatile professional with a passion for
          communication and community engagement. Currently serving as the
          Social Media Coordinator at The Church at Remerton, where I leverage
          my expertise in education to develop compelling marketing materials
          and engaging content across diverse platforms. Collaborative by
          nature, I work closely with leadership to align digital initiatives
          with organizational goals, ensuring a cohesive approach to event
          planning and execution. With a background in Spanish instruction at
          various educational institutions, including Valdosta City Schools and
          Brooks County High School, I bring a unique perspective to content
          creation, tailoring materials for storytelling and educational value.
          My experience extends beyond the classroom to roles in administration
          and office management, where I honed my skills in communication,
          organization, and customer service.
